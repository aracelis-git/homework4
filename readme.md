## Overview

Simple starter C++ project with:

- cmake
- googletest

## Installation

- Checkout the repo (and submodules)
```
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/dpiet/cpp-boilerplate.git
```
## Notes and Todo 
I would add a time array to allow simulations to be conducted with the class. 
Changing the variables to allow for array storage would also be necessary for simulation.
An extra test would be to ensure that the other variables could be not be manipulated using certain functions.
